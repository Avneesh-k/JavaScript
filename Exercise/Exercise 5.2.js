//  1. Set the starting counter to 0
let count = 0;
//  2. Create a variable, step, to increase your counter by
let step = 5;
//  3. Add a do while loop, printing the counter to the console and incrementing it 
// by the step amount each loop
do{
    console.log(count)
    count = count+step
}while(count<=100)
//  4. Continue to loop until the counter is equal to 100 or more than 100
